# 🎉 Railway Deployment - Final Solution

## ✅ What's Been Fixed:
- ✅ Database configuration updated to support `DB_TYPE` environment variable
- ✅ Frontend API URL fixed for production (uses relative URLs)
- ✅ Code changes pushed to GitHub (commits: 603aeb8, e17b19a)
- ✅ Railway will auto-redeploy with new code

## 🚀 Final Steps:

### 1. Add SQLite Variables in Railway:
Go to **Web Service** → **Variables** and add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DB_TYPE=sqlite
DB_PATH=/app/database.sqlite
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-jwt-key-2024-stok-yonetim
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=super-secret-refresh-key-2024-stok-yonetim
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=30d
```

### 2. Deploy:
- Railway should auto-deploy from GitHub push
- Or click **"Deploy"** button manually

## 🎯 Expected Result:
```
🔌 Veritabanı tipi: SQLITE
📁 SQLite veritabanı yolu: /app/database.sqlite
✅ SQLite veritabanı bağlantısı başarılı!
✅ Tablolar oluşturuldu
🚀 Server 5000 portunda çalışıyor
```

## 🌐 Your Demo URL:
Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
`https://your-app.up.railway.app`

## 🎊 Success!
Your customers will be able to access the stock management demo at the Railway URL!

**Note:** The MySQL service can be deleted since we're using SQLite now. SQLite is perfect for demos and small-scale usage.
